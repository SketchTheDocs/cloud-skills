# Cloud Skills: Sketchnotes Edition


Welcome to Cloud-Skills: Sketchnotes - a repository that started off as a place to host hi-resolution sketchnotes created by me (@nitya / Nitya Narasimhan) for various cloud computing and community events and presentations. It has since morphed into a repository that serves two purposes:
 * Host sketchnotes related to my [#VisualAzure](https://azure.cloud-skills.dev) initiative.
 * Motivate others to contribute their own sketchnotes to the repository for enjoyment by all.

## Usage

All sketchnotes remain the property of their creators so please provide attribution to this site (https://cloud-skills.dev) and to the sketchnote creator (using their preferred attribution statement) if you choose to share these publicly. In my case, that attribution involves tagging me (@nitya on Twitter) if directly sharing a link to the image, or sending me a request via the [Discussions Page](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/cloud-skills/discussions) if you wish to embed the sketchnote in an article, video or other content item.

Using sketchnotes for any commercial purposes is absolutely forbidden. Please reach out to me through the above page, or via twitter (@nitya, DMs are open) if you have a specific request and I might consider these on a case-by-case basis. **The primary use of these sketchnotes is to help people learn by providing them a single-page recap that can help with review, recall and retention, of studied information**.

## Contributors Guide

TBD - I welcome submissions from others who wish to have their sketchnotes listed here. I hope to update this section soon with some practical advice for creating a PR that can help make this seamless, while also preserving attribution correctly.
